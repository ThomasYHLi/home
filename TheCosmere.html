            <p>
                The Cosmere is the universe in which many of Brandon Sanderson&rsquo;s fiction book series take place.
				All the books take place in their own Shardworlds within the Cosmere universe. Shardworlds are planets that have Shardic presence.
				There is a total of 10 known shardworlds so far, and their unique magic systems are caused by a <a href="#myth">Shard of Adonalsium</a>.
            </p>

					<p>
						Brandon Sanderson is the author of the Cosmere and all its related stories. At first, his publisher encouraged him to write stand-alone stories that do not connect.
						This way, the publisher won&rsquo;t have to deal with books that they do not like. However, this format did not allow Sanderson to compose his huge epic fantasy series,
						so he made all his indepentent stories into a hidden epic. There is more information about the Cosmere and his works on his <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com">official website</a>.

                    <p>
                        The mythology of the Cosmere is based on one central god named Adonalsium. After the creation of the Cosmere,
                        Adonalsium was shattered into 16 shards, each surrounding an intent of creation. The shards traveled and scattered around the 10 shardworlds,
                        imbuing each world with its magic, therefore creating the unique magic systems that exist in the different series.

					<p>
						Each shardworld in the Cosmere has its own unique magic system influenced by its related shard. However, 
						all the magic that exists in the Cosmere are all centered around magic energy known as Investiture. Everything contained a certain amount of investiture,
						and all the magic that exists is based on different methods of using the energy. The amount of Investiture that is imbued in a world depending on the number of shards that resides there.
						For example, Roshar from The Stormlight Archive, is under the influence of 3 shards: Odium, Cultivation, and Honor. 
						As a result, the world is populated by highly concentrated and sentient Investitures called spren.
